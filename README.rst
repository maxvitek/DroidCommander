Footman
=======

Footman is a long-listening voice activated digital servant suitable
for binding different home automation paradigms to a unified interface.
A central corps of workers takes commands from listeners.  New commands
and abilities are added via a straight-forward plugin architecture.

`Here is an early version.`_

Usage
-----

Create a settings.py (as you would in Django) based on the sample-settings.py.

Use honcho to launch:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ honcho start listener
    ...
    $ honcho start footman
    ...

#.  It's a little early.  Once I have all the planned plugins written I
will welcome help with open arms.
